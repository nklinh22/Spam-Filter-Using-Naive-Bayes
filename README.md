# Spam-Filter-Using-Naive-Bayes

This is to build spam filter for SMS messages using multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm. 
The goal is to write a program that classifies new messages with accuracy greater than 80%, which mean we expect that more than 80% of the new messages will be classified correctly as spam or non-spam.

"SMSSpamCollection" file contains a dataset of 5572 SMS messages that are already classified by humans. he dataset was put together by Tiago A. Almeida and José María Gómez Hidalgo, and it can be downloaded from the The UCI Machine Learning Repository. The data collection process is described in more details on the 2 links below, where you can also find some of the papers authored by Tiago A. Almeida and José María Gómez Hidalgo.
